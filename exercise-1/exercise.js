//For each "entering" element in the data join, create a new <p> item
//Give that item text that contains BOTH the index number of the person and
//their name. For example:
//    <p>0. Edgar</p>
//Additionally, use the `style()` method to give that list item a 'color'
//property that is the person's favorite color.



//Add an event listener to the button to that on a click, the following occurs:
//  Select all the <p> elements in the list
//  Join the `people2` data set to that selection
//      You will need to set a "key function" so people are tracked by `name`
//  Log out the number of "entering" elements
//  Log out the number of "exiting" elements
//  Remove all exiting elements


//Add a transition() to the above so that the existing elements first have
//their `opacity` (set via `style()`) change to 0.0 over 1 second, before
//they are removed
